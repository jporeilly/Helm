### <font color='red'> 2.1.1 Helm Charts </font>
In this Lab you will build a Guestbook v1 Helm Chart.  
Ensure you're in the correct directory if you're using the integrated terminal.

create a guestbook directory:
```
sudo mkdir guestbook
```
change to guestbook directory:
```
cd guestbook
```
add a Chart.yaml file:
```
sudo nano Chart.yaml
```
add the following:
```
apiVersion: v2
appVersion: "1.0"
description: A Helm chart for Guestbook 1.0 
name: guestbook
version: 0.1.0
type: application
```
create a templates directory:
```
sudo mkdir templates
```
copy over the yaml files:
```
sudo cp ../yaml/*.yaml templates
```
so you should have the following structure:  
```
tree guestbook
```

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand Guestbook v1 tree!</summary>
 
> guestbook   
> Chart.yaml  

<details>
  <summary>templates</summary>

>>  Chart.yaml  
>>>    frontend-service.yaml  
>>>    frontend.yaml  
>>>    ingress.yaml  
   </details>
</details>
